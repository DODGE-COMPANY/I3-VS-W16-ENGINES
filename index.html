<p><img class="img1"src="https://imgr1.auto-motor-und-sport.de/BMW-116d-Motor-169FullWidth-5e5428a3-861098.jpg"/> The BMW B38 is a 1.2 and 1.5 L (1,198 and 1,499 cc) turbocharged straight-three DOHC petrol engine, which replaced the straight-four BMW N13. Production started in 2013.

It is part of a modular BMW engine family of straight-three (B38), straight-four (B48) and straight-six (B58) alloy block and head petrol engines,[1] which use a displacement of 400 cc (24.4 cu in) per cylinder in the 1.2 and 500 cc (30.5 cu in) per cylinder in the 1.5. It specifically shares a lot of components with the BMW B37, due to their same size/configuration.

The B38 is used in front-wheel drive cars (such as the Mini Hatch and BMW 2 Series Active Tourer), as well as BMW's traditional rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive (xDrive) configurations. The first car to use the B38 is the BMW i8 hybrid sports coupé,[2] where it is used as a transverse mid-mounted engine.[3] </p>

The Audi TT RS and Audi RS3 currently use straight-five engines. In motorsport, the first car to use a straight-five engine was the Audi Quattro rally car;[13] other racing cars which used straight-five engines include the 1985-1986 Audi Sport Quattro E2 and the 1989 Audi 90 Quattro IMSA GTO.[14][15][16][17] For the year 1987 factory team tested a 1000 hp version of the inline-5 powered Audi S1 Sport Quattro.[18]</p> <p> 2.5 L I5 TFSI (AUDI COMPANY)</p> <p><img class="img1"src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.74e94d869a973d1e44cc24be5c86ded7?rik=zZBKCUNyqw7luQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2fhdcarwallpapers.com%2fwalls%2f2012_audi_tt_coupe-wide.jpg&ehk=bXRf7Wr1XP0i0CFwo3TjVgJVnT6RuluwFo2BsDiPZwo%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0"> (AUDI TT) In August 2004, Audi announced that the next generation TT would be manufactured using aluminium, and would go into production in 2007.[20] A preview of the second-generation TT was provided in the form of the Audi Shooting Brake concept car, shown at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2005. This concept was an insight into the new TT, but featured angular styling, and a "shooting-brake" two-door hatchback body style.[21]

Audi debuted the second-generation TT, internal designation Type 8J, on 6 April 2006, using the Volkswagen Group A5 (PQ35) platform with aluminium front bodypanels, and steel in the rear, to enhance its near-neutral front-to-rear weight distribution. Available in front-wheel drive or "quattro" four-wheel drive layout, the TT was again offered as a 2+2 Coupé, and as a two-seater Roadster. The second generation was five inches longer and three inches wider than its predecessor.[22] Factory production commenced during August 2006.[23]</p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_TT">wikipedia Audi TT</a>

From 2004 to 2013, it was the only available gasoline engine in the Ram Heavy Duty. Chrysler later made the 5.7 L Hemi available in all models of the 2004 Dodge Ram, Dodge Durango, the 2005 Chrysler 300C, Dodge Magnum R/T, Jeep Grand Cherokee, the 2006 Dodge Charger R/T, Jeep Commander, the 2007 Chrysler Aspen, the 2009 Dodge Challenger R/T, and the 2022 Jeep Wagoneer. For manual transmission applications (Challenger and 3/4- and 1-ton Ram pickups), cylinder deactivation is not included.

The 5.7 L (345 cu in) Hemi in the Ram delivered 345 hp (257.3 kW) and 375 lb⋅ft (508 N⋅m), but 340 hp (253.5 kW) and 390 lb⋅ft (529 N⋅m) for the 300C and Magnum R/T, which is exactly 100 hp (74.6 kW) more than the old 5.9 engine. It is a 90-degree V8, 2-valve pushrod design like the past Magnum series engines, displacing 5,654 cc (345 cu in), with a bore of 3.917 in (99.49 mm) and a stroke of 3.578 in (90.88 mm).[21]

The 5.7 L Hemi is made at Chrysler's Saltillo Engine plant in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico.

The Hemi was on the Ward's 10 Best Engines list for 2003 through 2007, and again in 2009.</p>

First shown at the 2022 North American International Auto Show, it is assembled at Ford's Flat Rock Assembly Plant and began production on May 1, 2023,[4][5] initially available with either the redesigned 2.3L EcoBoost turbocharged 4-cylinder with 315 horsepower, or the revised, 4th generation Coyote V8 with 480–486 horsepower in the GT and 500 horsepower in the Dark Horse.[6][7][8] On September 14, 2022, Ford introduced the seventh-generation Mustang at the North American International Auto Show, in a special event called "The Stampede".[9][10] As part of its introduction, multiple track-only models were showcased, such as a NASCAR Cup Series body, a V8 Supercar version, multiple GT racing versions, among others. Also announced was the addition of the “Dark Horse” series. Bridging the gap between the Mach 1 and now-discontinued GT350, the Dark Horse performs much the same role as the 2012-2013 Boss 302 Mustangs— a street legal car with enhanced performance on road courses around the world.</p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Mustang">wikipedia Ford Mustang</a>

Bore and stroke size is 3.552 in × 4.165 in (90.2 mm × 105.8 mm), identical to the 5.4 L V8. Both 2-valve and 3-valve versions have been produced. The 6.8 L uses a split-pin crank with 72° firing intervals and a balance shaft gear driven by the left camshaft to quell vibrations inherent to a 90° bank angle V10 engine. The engine's firing order is 1-6-5-10-2-7-3-8-4-9. The 2-valve version was first introduced in 1997, with a 3-valve non-VCT (the use of VCT was precluded by the presence of the balance shaft, as the shaft needed to remain in phase with the crankshaft) version to following in 2005.

Vehicles equipped with the 6.8 L V10 Modular engine include the following: </p>

The model became part of the SRT division and for marketing purposes was designated SRT Viper at first. However, from the second half of 2014, the model reverted to the Dodge brand designation and became known as the Dodge Viper SRT,[1] due to weak sales, including due to poor awareness of the SRT brand.

Unlike the previous two generations (1992 and 2003), this model was initially presented with a closed coupe body. Traditionally, with the advent of a fundamentally new generation of the model, the corporate logo was changed, receiving the designation "Stryker" and a new viper head. As with previous generations of coupes, the rear emblem acts as an additional brake light.

The body styling features design motifs from previous generations, with a long hood and a cab attached to the rear axle. For example, the outlines of the front fenders, in which there are holes that remove hot air from the engine, are made in the style of the first and second generations of the model. The exhaust pipes are still brought out from the sides at the rear of the sills. The roof has bulges under the heads of the driver and passenger, the so-called "double bubble".

The bodywork is 50% stiffer, and the exterior body panels are made of aluminum and carbon.[6] The tubular frame is almost entirely made of durable steel.[8]

The engine is a further upgrade of the old V10, which has increased power to 640 hp (bhp) and reduced weight by 11 kg. An open version of the roadster is planned for the future[1].

In the fall of 2015, unofficial information appeared that the car could be discontinued in 2017. In August 2017, the last car rolled off the assembly line of the Conner Assembly Plant.</p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Viper">wikipedia Dodge Viper SRT</a>

The N73 was the world's first production V12 engine to use gasoline direct injection.[1]
Compared with its M73 predecessor, the N73 has dual overhead camshafts, double-VANOS variable valve timing and valvetronic variable valve lift .[2][3] The variable valve timing (VANOS) is a continuously variable design and is present on both the intake and exhaust camshafts. The VANOS units were designed as integral components of the chain drive, and the adjustment ranges are 63 degrees for the intake camshaft and 60 degrees for the exhaust camshaft.[4] The redline for the N73 is 6,500 rpm.</p>

It was named after the racing driver Pierre Veyron.

The original version has a top speed of 407 km/h (253 mph).[5][6] It was named the 2000s Car of the Decade by the BBC television programme Top Gear. The standard Veyron also won Top Gear's Best Car Driven All Year award in 2005.

The Super Sport version of the Veyron is one of the fastest street-legal production cars in the world, with a top speed of 431.072 km/h (267.856 mph).[7] The Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse was the fastest roadster in the world, reaching an averaged top speed of 408.84 km/h (254.04 mph) in a test on 6 April 2013.[8][9]

The Veyron's chief designer was Hartmut Warkuß, with the exterior being designed by Jozef Kabaň of Volkswagen. Much of the engineering work was conducted under the guidance of chief technical officer Wolfgang Schreiber. The Veyron includes a sound system designed and built by Burmester Audiosysteme.[10]

Several special variants have been produced. In December 2010, Bugatti began offering prospective buyers the ability to customise exterior and interior colours by using the Veyron 16.4 Configurator application on the marque's official website.[11][12] The Bugatti Veyron was discontinued in late 2014, but special edition models continued to be produced until 2015.</p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Veyron">wikipedia Bugatti Veyron</a> Thank You For Watching I'm Speight
